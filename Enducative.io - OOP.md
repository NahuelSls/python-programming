# <center> INFORMATION HIDING
## What is information hiding?

### Introduction
It's important to understand that objects and classes are the fundamental entities for OOP.
<br>Classes contain properties and using objects we can manipulate or access these properties.
<br>The purpose for the information hiding is to implement instances that can't modify the original content.

### A real life example
An example using the interaction between a patient with a doctor without knowing the inner working of the doctor. 

### Components of data hiding
> There are two primary components of data hiding:
- Encapsulation 
- Abstraction

## Encapsulation

### Definition
This is a fundamental programming technique to achieve data hiding. 

Encapsulation it refers to binding data and the methods to manipulate that data at the same time in a single unit, class. 

A little summary about the encapsulation is that it encapsulates different classes with privates variables that will restrict the access to the class by the code. 
<br>But "how can they be used outside that class?"
<br>The answer is to declare public methods to let the outside to comunicate with the inner of a class. These methods are called 'setters' and 'getters'. 
It can be implemented custom methods.

### Advantages of encapsulation
> There are some advantages of encapsulation:
- Classes made easy to maintain and change the code 
- Properties to be hidden can be specified easily 
- We can choose which outside classes or functions can access the class properties

## Getters and Setters

### Get and set 
Getters and Setters are used to allow controlled access to properties outside the class.
> Getter method allows reading a property's value

> Setter method allows to modify a property's value

In Python is common to use "set" and "get" to use this command.

### Example
There are an example using getters and setters to understand how it works this commands. 
```
for name in range(0 to 5):

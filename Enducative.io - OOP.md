# INFORMATION HIDING
## What is information hiding?

>### Introduction
> It's important to understand that objects and classes are the fundamental entities for OOP.
Classes contain properties and using objects we can manipulate or access these properties.
The purpose for the information hiding is to implement instances that can't modify the original content.

>### A real life example
>An example using the interaction between a patient with a doctor without knowing the inner working of the doctor. 

>### Components of data hiding
> There are two primary components of data hiding:
> - Encapsulation 
> - Abstraction

## Encapsulation
This is a fundamental programming technique to achieve data hiding. 

Encapsulation it refers to binding data and the methods to manipulate that data at the same time in a single unit, class. 

A little summary about the encapsulation is that it encapsulates different classes with privates variables that will restrict the acces to the class by the code. 
But "how can they be used outside that class?"
The answer is to declare public methods to let the outside to comunicate with the inner of a class. These methods are called 'setters' and 'getters'. 
It can be implemented custom methods. 

> There are some advantages of encapsulation:
- Classes made easy to maintain and change the code 
- Properties to be hidden can be specified easily 
- We can choose which outside classes or functions can access the class properties

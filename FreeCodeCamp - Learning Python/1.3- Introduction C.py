# Basic terminal commands to understand how it works python3 but using pycharm
x = 5           # = 5
y = x + 2       # = 7
z = x + y - 1   # = 11

# Values of the variables that we introduced before
print(x)
print(y)
print(z, '\n')

# Another form that we can print all the variables at the same line. We can put some text to explain what are each number of the output
print(x, y, z)
print('The value introduced is', x, 'but doing some calculation it can be', y, 'or', z)

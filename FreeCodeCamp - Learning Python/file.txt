To be plausible, the descriptive writer has to constrain the concrete, evocative image to suit the reader’s knowledge and attention span.
“Her eyes were brighter than the sapphires in the armrests of the Tipu Sultan’s golden throne, yet sharper than the tulwars of his cruelest executioners” will have the reader checking their phone halfway through.
“Her eyes were sapphires, bright and hard” creates the same effect in a fraction of the reading time.
As always in the craft of writing:
when in doubt, write less.

There are something interesting in the forrest.
